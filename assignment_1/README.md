# First git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

# Second git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   assignment_1/README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

# Purpose of the following commands
- `mkdir`: Creates a new directory
- `cd`: Changes directory
- `code`: Opens a visual basics code inside of your chosen folder
- `ls`: Lists content of chosen directory

# Why  Version Control is Important
## with version control, it is possible to:
- Track Changes: Keep track of changes made to files and directories while also allowing users to revert to previous versions, compare changes between versions and to understand the history of a file or directory.
- Promote Collaboration: Allows multiple users to modify and contribute to a projecy simultaneously without conflict.
- Branch: Allows users to create a multitude of branches, which can be written individually, tested and then merged back into the single main branch.
- Merge: Combines the changes made by different people and branches.
- Access Control: Allows control of individual access to certain sections of a project.
- Backup and Recovery: A backup system to allow for storing of file and directory versions.
- Annotate changes: Allows annotation for changes, Allows for meaningful context and description of said changes.
- Integrate: The Version Control system can be integrated with other beneficial tools.
- Support Auditing: Enables users to track changes.

# Purpose of the following Git Commands
- `git init`: Creates a new repository.
- `git status`: Displays the current status of the repository.
- `git add`: Adds file(s) to the staging area for the next commit to the repository.
- `git commit`: Records and moves files from the staging area to the repository. It also creates a snapshot of the changes as well as the data about the commit including the author's name and email address, date and time of the commit, and commit message if inputed once prompted.
- `git push`: Pushes the local changes made to the remote repository.
- `git pull`: Grabs the changes made in the remote repository and merges those changes into the local repository.
- `git log`: Displays the list of all commits in a repository's history.
- `git branch`: Creates a new branch that allows an individual to create a new working copy of the code that exists independently of the main branch and any other branch. An individual can create as many branches as they need.
- `git merge`: Merges changes from different branches into a single branch. This branch can be the main branch or a seperate branch.
- `git checkout`: Switches between different branches

# My Unique Touch
## Describe something that sets you apart from others:
- Something that sets me apart from others would be the high standards I hold myself to once I begin working on a project, as well as my naturally curly hair.
